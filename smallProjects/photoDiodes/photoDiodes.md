# Read values of photo-diodes board

[Home](../../README.md)

**Goal:** Getting started with programming of the STM32. Generate a 10MH frequency for the photo-diodes board. Power that board and manage to retrieve data from the chip.

-> check out what **silicon die** is
-> check out what **quantum efficiency** is

## The STM32 board

The board that we are going to use is a NUCLEO-F303RE STM32.
