Setup environment to program STM32 on Windows: [https://wiki.octanis.org/stm32/vscode](https://wiki.octanis.org/stm32/vscode)

__Goal:__ Getting started with programming of the STM32. Generate a 10MH frequency for the photo-diodes board. Power that board and manage to retrieve data from the chip.

-> check out what __silicon die__ is

## The board

The board that we are going to use is a NUCLEO-F303RE STM32.
