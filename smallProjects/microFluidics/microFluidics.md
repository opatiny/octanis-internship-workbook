# Micro fluidics application

[Home](../../README.md)

__Goal :__ Find an application in micro-fluidics for the valve control developed by Octanis Instruments. We should consider that it is possible to get a precise pressure at some point in a pneumatic circuit. Design the load.

__Idea :__ Device allowing to get 5 precise concentrations of a solution from a concentrated solution and a solvent. The final solutions should allow to realise calibration curves.
