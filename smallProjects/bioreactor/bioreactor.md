# Octanis made bioreactor

The bioreactor must allow to maintain four 1/2 liter jars at a precise temperature, stir (CO2 bubbles), and control the luminosity of each jar with a plexiglass light-diffusing stick.

## Problem

Make an interface between a Soda Fresh CO2 bottle and the bioreactor -> it has a non-standard thread. The output should be a connector for a 4mm soft tube.

## Solution

Design a 3D part in Fusion360 that will be 3D printed in PLA. This is quite tricky because the part has overhangs.
