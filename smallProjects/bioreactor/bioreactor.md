# Octanis made bioreactor

The bioreactor must allow to maintain four 1/2 liter jars at a precise temperature, stir (CO2 bubbles), and control the luminosity of each jar with a plexiglass light-diffusing stick.

The bioreactor is based on the previous project in collaboration with Univalle:

## CO2 can to 4 mm rubber tube interface

**Problem:** Make an interface between a Soda Fresh CO2 bottle and the bioreactor -> it has a non-standard thread. The output should be a connector for a 4mm soft tube. Take into consideration that they are 230 bars of pressure in a full can.

**Solution:** Design a 3D part in Fusion360 that will be 3D printed in PLA. This is quite tricky because the part has overhangs.

The can has a non-standard thread, which had to be modeled in Fusion360 from scratch. To get it right, we proceeded with trial and error, until the part could be screwed well.

## Lid

The lid of the bioreactor contain a cooling unit recuperated from a drinks cooler. It has to fit around the main part of the bioreactor. The material used to build it is 6mm MDF that is then spray-painted black for aesthetics and humidity resistance. [The model](./dxf/lid-v13.dxf) was designed in Fusion and then laser-cut.
