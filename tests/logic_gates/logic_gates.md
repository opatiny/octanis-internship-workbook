# Small side project: transistors logic gates building blocs

__Goal :__ Make PCBs that act as logic gates based on transistors (NOT, OR, AND). Understand how transistors work and how to build logic gates using them. Draw the schematics that correspond to the 3 logic gates AND, OR and NOT. Transpose to KiCAD, make layout and send for production. Find a smart way to interconnect the boards. Make the boards as small as possible.

## Basic schematics
