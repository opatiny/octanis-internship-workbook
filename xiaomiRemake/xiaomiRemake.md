# Vacuum cleaner robot

[Home](../README.md) | [Links / References](./docs/refs.md) | [Project PCBs doc](./docs/pcd/pcb.md)

## Goal

Make a vacuum cleaning robot applying the technologies developed at Octanis Instruments. The robot will use some of the same components as the Xiaomi Mi Roborock (already existing vacuum cleaner robot). Yet, all the user interface, the electronics and the sensors will be new.

## Things to consider (perspectives)

- we could place a robotic arm on the robot if it supported the weight ([AR2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCgI4R1TEzI))
- adaptive gripper? [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527079](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527079) and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9KWuQXTURI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9KWuQXTURI)
- add LEDs or a microphone for user interface
