# XIAOMI MI ROBOROCK Remake

## Goal
Make a vacuum cleaning robot applying the technologies developped at Octanis Instruments. The robot will use some of the same components as the Xiaomi Mi Roborock robot. Yet, all the user interface, the electronics and the sensors will be new.

## Project execution

First of all, the focus has been put on the mechanical aspect of the project: in other words, the case. This had to be made using the techniques at disposition, namely laser cutting and 3D printing. Laser cutting has the advantage to be fast, however, the shapes that can be realized are limited. On the contrary, 3D printing is slow, but allows a large variety of shapes (especially with resin printing -> to try out!).

To realize the models (either 2 or 3D), __Fusion 360__ has been used, which is an open-source CAD software.

__General concept of the case:__ The case is has an __octogonal base__ with a width of about 400 mm and a height of about 100 mm. The sides, top and bottom are laser-cut out of transparent acrylic glass. The case holds together thanks to screws and dented sides that slot one into the other. The inner components are all maintained in place by specific 3D printed parts.
