# Observations made as the project evolved

## After assembling the case for the first time

### Things to enhance

- replace material used for top and bottom parts (PS) by plexiglass
- since the Prusa printers didn't work, the corner had to be printed in two parts. This has to be enhanced in further versions! Printing with the Prusas should also allow to print the M3 threads directly, which will increase the solidity
- The front wheel part has to be remodeled so that the wheel is not so high (as it is, the brushed wouldn't touch the floor).
- review the main wheels holes: when the robot is not touching the floor, the wheels should be "opened"
- find a way to fix the screen in place -> metal bars?
- model the 3D printed part that will fix the wheels
- finish modeling the dust collector/pump interface

### Things that are good

- screen fits very well
- corners are the right size
- the flap closing system works -> flexible hinges were a good idea
- lidar fits
- side brush fits
