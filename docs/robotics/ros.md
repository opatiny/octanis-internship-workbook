## Base OS : Xenial

To be able to install ROS, you need a computer with Xenial (Ubuntu 16.04), which is the best supported OS.

## Install ROS on computer

We will use ROS Kinetic, which you can install by following this tutorial:

## ROS on RaspBerry Pi

Our goal is to have ROS installed on a robot which has a Raspberry pi as a micro-processor.

An image of Ubuntu with ROS for Rapsberry Pi can be downloaded here: [https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html).
