# Week 3 - Wheeled locomotion

[Home](../../../../README.md) | [Mobile Robotics](../mobileRobotics.md)

- locomotion: power of motion from place to place
- a wheel has two parameters: the **roll forward** (angular speed) and the **orientation** (to know the global position of the robot)
- a robot that moves in a plane has **three degrees of freedom** (2 translations, 1 rotation)

## Instantaneous Center of Curvature

**Def:** midpoint of the circle on which the robot moves (ICC)

A robot can have two types of movement:

- move on a circle
- move on a straight line

## Differential drive

Imagine a robot with two wheels. You can make it turn by having a **difference of rotation speed** (or translation speed) between the two wheels. Two motors required.

-> see notebook for equations

Parameters in the equations:

- $v_l$ : translation speed of left wheel
- $v_r$ : translation speed of right wheel
- $R$ : radius of the circle the robot is turning on
- $l$ : distance between the wheels
- $\omega$ : angular speed of the robot
- $\theta$ : orientation of the robot from x axis

## Ackermann drive

A robot with three wheels. The same as before with an additional front wheel that is not controlled (passive). Two motors required. Limited in the possible trajectories! -> you have to manoeuvre to get to certain points, like in a car to park

## Synchronous drive

A robot with three wheels, generally circular, all wheels have the same forward velocity. When the robot turns, all the wheels have the same angular velocity (achieved using a chain). Four motors required. Every trajectories can be followed with this kind of robot.

## XR4000 drive

A robot with four wheels that can all be turned separately. Constraint: all the wheels must move on a circle around the ICC. In certain conditions, this kind of robot can turn on the spot.

## Mecanum wheels

Kind of wheels that allows the robot to move sideways. They work by having "rolls" all around the wheels. The rolls on the front and back wheels are placed in opposite directions. If the four wheel move forward, nothing happens. If the front wheels got forward and the back wheels tgo backwards, the robot moves sideways.

## Holonomy

Non-Holonomic constraints apply to robots that cannot realize all movements/ follow all existing trajectories.

For instance, a car has non-holonomic contrains.

Mecanum drive do not ave non-holonomic contrains.

**Dead reckoning:** deducing the position of a robot by calculating the theoretical position of the robot after some commands were given to it.

**Odometry:** figuring out where the robot is using information about the environment that is sensed.
