- **Autonomous robot:** has to perceive it's environment and make decisions what to do next to achieve is goal
- **Robots yesterday:** repetitive tasks, "arms" connected to the ground -> immobile, factory applications
- **Current applications:** robots that move, are autonomous, can be used at home
- first mobile robot: 1966


## Exercices conclusions

- what is the **standard deviation** of an array?  
  "In statistics, the standard deviation (SD, also represented by the lower case Greek letter sigma Ïƒ for the population standard deviation or the Latin letter s for the sample standard deviation) is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.[1] A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values." - Wikipedia
