### runes v3

- Date :
- Printer: bottom Prusa
- Print settings: 0.2mm QUALITY
- Filament: Generic PLA (but printed Glow in the dark PLA)

### runes v3

- Date :
- Printer: bottom Prusa
- Print settings: 0.2mm QUALITY
- Filament: Glow in the dark PLA (custom parameters, bed temperature 70C)
- Infill: 25%

-> **solution:** heating the bed at 70C instead of 60C and cleaning it with isopropanol first really made a difference in the adhesion

- Date : 2019.07.15
- Printer: black PLA Renkforce
- Print settings: 0.2mm Draft
- Filament: PLA (black)
- Infill: 20%

-> print failed because the bed moved (one of the magnets unglued), so I glued the magnet in placed with hot glue and ran it again

**Problem:** on the contrary of the Prusa printers, the quality is not good enough for the M3 thread to work.

### corner 2 parts v2 (with thread)

- Date : 2019.07.15
- Printer: black PLA Renkforce
- Print settings: 0.2mm Draft
- Filament: PLA (black)
- Infill: 20%

- Printer: black PLA Renkforce
- Print settings: 0.15mm Normal
- Filament: PLA (black)
- Infill: 20%

**Special:** support and adhesion boxes checked in Cura

### small PCB cases for distance module (v10)

- Date : 2019.07.30
- Printer: Cetus3D
- Print settings: 0.2mm Normal
- Filament: Prusament PLA (grey)
- Infill: 20%

**Special:** support added in Up Studio

Tried to print the case many times, but it always failed because of adhesion and calibration that were bad.

### small PCB cases for distance module (v10)

- Date : 2019.07.31
- Printer: bottom Prusa
- Print settings: 0.2mm QUALITY
- Filament: Prusament PLA (grey)
- Infill: 20%

**Problem:** The filament spool wasn't unwinding correctly and it fell off the printer, breaking the filament. The printer started beeping when there was nearly no filament left and asked to unload filament. I unloaded the filament and loaded it again and the print resumed.

### front wheel fix 2 (v4)

- Date : 2019.09.03
- Printer: bottom Prusa
- Print settings: 0.2mm QUALITY
- Filament: Prusament PLA (black)

Prints astonishingly succeeded -> despite the consistent overhang

### frontWheelFix2

- Date : 2019.09.08
- Printer: bottom Prusa
- Print settings: 0.2mm QUALITY
- Filament: Prusament PLA (black)
- Infill: 15%

The print didn't come out really well -> stripes visible on the part -> under-extrusion?
Also, the 15% filling was not enough -> the center cylinder broke when trying to remove the wheel
