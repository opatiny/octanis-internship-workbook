## Electrical circuits and components

### H-bridge
An H-bridge is an electrical circuit which allows to chose in which direction current is flowing. It can be used to control the spin direction of a motor. It basically consists of four transistors.

### Clamping diode

### Zener diode
-> would allow to make an easy voltage divider

### EDS diode
Protective component against electro-static discharges.

### Low-pass filter
