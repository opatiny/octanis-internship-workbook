## Errors

### X or Y hard limit error

- clear the error
- press home

### -Z hard limit error

Once you get this error (because the laser hit the bed or something), the software doesn't allow you to move the bed up or down anymore. So, you have move it down. To do that, slip your fingers under the front panel of the laser cutter to access the belt. Pilling it towards the right should make the bed go down. Clear the error.
