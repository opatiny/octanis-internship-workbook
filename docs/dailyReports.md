# Internship at Octanis Instruments: diary

## June

### 01.06.2019
- signed contract
- setup computer
- installed apps (Fusion360, KiCAD, Git, VS Code), problem with installing Terminal for Windows
- __project to start working on:__ remake the Xiaomi vacuum cleaner robot using Octanis' technologies

- saw parts already available for vacuum cleaner
- started getting used to Fusion 360
- __Note:__ a big disadvantage od Fusion 360 is that you can't save the files on another support than AutoDesk -> no git (except for the exports)

__Remarks:__ The approach to the vacuum cleaner that Sam asked me to follow is top-down: I must consider that all the electronics exist and work (-> abstraction!). It's different from all the other projects I have made where I prioritized a bottom-up approach. I could do that since I was working alone. Therefore, I have to learn __teamwork__.


### 02.06.2019
