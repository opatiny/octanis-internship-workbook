# Weekly meetings

## 2019-06-05 10:00h

- use o-ring to connect pump to dust collector
- construct global case and create modules for distinct parts that are all the same height (can be on two floors)
- consider making an hermetic case for the core PCBs
- use metallic threads that are fixed in 3D printed holes (using a soldering machine)
- better put too much sensors than not enough -> consider 8 peripheral boards on the faces with distance, fall and bump detection + Lidar on top + camera (on front face?)
- consider that the wheels will be fully squeezed when robot working -> the wheels have a sensor that knows when the robot is lifted
- maximal height that can be 3D printed is about 20 cm
- pump should be fixed using three small printed parts that are screwed on top


## 2019-06-12 10:00h

- Send distance sensor board datasheet 
- Electronics
  - Computer 
  - 10 channels
  - Motor, feedback from Raffael on modifications needed (encoder, temp, different chip)


- Things to get:
  - Screen
  - Camera
  - Lidar
  - Plexiglass 5mm transparent
  - Screws: M3x12 (100), 
  - Angle measurement device
  - Brass brush
  - Nylon
  - Battery

My remarks:
- resumed the things I learned in Fusion (assembly, technical drawing) and while repairing the 3D printers (cold pull)
- understand H bridge
- find / reverse engineer wheels motors pin-out
- try printing hinge in flexible material!
- add an easy way to remove the battery for recharge!
