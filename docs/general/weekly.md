- use o-ring to connect pump to dust collector
- construct global case and create modules for distinct parts that are all the same height (can be on two floors)
- consider making an hermetic case for the core PCBs
- use metallic threads that are fixed in 3D printed holes (using a soldering machine)
- better put too much sensors than not enough -> consider 8 peripheral boards on the faces with distance, fall and bump detection + Lidar on top + camera (on front face?)
- consider that the wheels will be fully squeezed when robot working -> the wheels have a sensor that knows when the robot is lifted
- maximal height that can be 3D printed is about 20 cm
- pump should be fixed using three small printed parts that are screwed on top


## 2019-06-12 10:00h

- Send distance sensor board datasheet 
- Electronics
  - Computer 
  - 10 channels
  - Motor, feedback from Raffael on modifications needed (encoder, temp, different chip)


- Things to get:
  - Screen
  - Camera
  - Lidar
  - Plexiglass 5mm transparent
  - Screws: M3x12 (100), 
  - Angle measurement device
  - Brass brush
  - Nylon 3D printer filament
  - Battery

My remarks:
- resumed the things I learned in Fusion (assembly, technical drawing) and how to repair the 3D printers (cold pull)
- understand H bridge
- find / reverse engineer wheels motors pin-out
- try printing hinge in flexible material!
- add an easy way to remove the battery for recharge!

Progress of last week specifically on the vacuum project is not very big. Lots of parentheses have been done (testing things with the 3D printer, the laser cutter, learning about transistor logic).

To do next week?
- priority 0 : finish and order distance boards (-> investigate rigid-flex PCB?), understand how to export good BOM and import it to Octopart
- priority 1 : get missing parts (lidar, camera, battery)
- priority 1 : setup computer for STM32 programming and write basic program (-> photo-diodes small project)
- priority 3 : continue fusion 360 parts for vacuum cleaner
- priority 4 : investigate micro-fluidics application
