# Lidar on the VacRob

One of the main sensors that are placed on the robot is a lidar. This works by emitting a laser pulse and calculating the time it takes to get back (light sensor). The whole device spins, which allows to get distance measurements on a whole plane with a high resolution (1 pt/degree). The lidar that we use is the **Neato XV11 Lidar** (that is found on the neato vacuum robots).

## Some specifications

**Neato XV11 lidar:**

- 360 points per rotation
- controlled through UART (RX/TX)
- around 100 USD

## Position and fixation on the VacRob

The lidar is placed on the robot's top, about 15 cm away from it's center. It is fixed with spacers and 4 M3 screws. The laser is at a height of about 20 cm above the ground. This could be a problem to detect very low objects, but the distance modules should compensate this a little.

## Wiring

Neato lidar pinout

They are 6 cables to connect.


Computer module:
- **Motor:** GND and 3.3V
  - GND: H102, pin 28
  - 3.3V: J104, pa
- **Comms:** RX and TX (solder 0 Ohm resistors on JP111 and JP112)
  - RX: H10, pin 39
  - TX: H101, pin 40
- **Lidar power:** GND and 5V
  - GND: H102, pin 25
  - 5V: H102, pin 29

## Reading data from serial

First setup:
- we connect the robot computer to an external screen, keyboard and mouse
- we get internet through an Ethernet cable
- we power the raspberry through micro usb -> this also powers the lidar and the lidar motor

More advanced setup:
- Raspberry powered by micro USB
- Raspberry hosting VNC server
- computer connected to the VNC server to see and act on what's on the touch screen of the raspi

We use the `screen` command to see if there is any data on the serial bus. `screen` takes two arguments: port and baud rate!  
  ```bash
  screen /dev/ttyAMA0 115200
  ```

To see all the serial devices that are accessible, use this bash command:
```bash
dmesg | grep tty
```

## Plotting data in `rviz`

Procedure to follow: [https://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node](https://wiki.ros.org/xv_11_laser_driver/Tutorials/Running%20the%20XV-11%20Node)

Install driver package:
```bash
udo apt-get install ros-kinetic-xv-11-laser-driver
```

Build driver from source:
```bash
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/rohbotics/xv_11_laser_driver.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

Launch ROS:
```bash
roscore
```

To kill ROS (it can be useful after some new installs), just use:
```bash
killall roscore
```

Finally, launch the lidar driver (in background):
```bash
rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 &
```

You should also create a reference frame for the lidar data to be shown:
```bash
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 map my_fra 10 &
```

To see what are the inputs that ROS detects (very useful for debug):
```bash
rostopic list
```

In all the parameters listed, `/rpms` is the number of rotations per minute that the lidar does (it should be around 360!) and `/scan` is the data generated by the lidar.

```bash
rostopic echo /screen
```

Launch `rviz`:
```bash
rosrun rviz rviz
```

## To do every time `rviz` is run

Create frame called `neato_laser`:
```bash
rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 map neato_laser 10 &
```

Run lidar driver:
```bash
rosrun xv_11_laser_driver neato_laser_publisher _port:=/dev/ttyUSB0 &
```

Launch `rviz`:
```bash
rosrun rviz rviz
```
