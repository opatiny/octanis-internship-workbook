# Observations made after assemblies

## First assembly (2019.07.19)

### Things to enhance

- replace material used for top and bottom parts (PS) by plexiglass
- since the Prusa printers didn't work, the corner had to be printed in two parts. This has to be enhanced in further versions! Printing with the Prusas should also allow to print the M3 threads directly, which will increase the solidity
- The front wheel part has to be remodeled so that the wheel is not so high (as it is, the brushed wouldn't touch the floor).
- review the main wheels holes: when the robot is not touching the floor, the wheels should be "opened"
- find a way to fix the screen in place -> metal bars?
- model the 3D printed part that will fix the wheels
- finish modeling the dust collector/pump interface

### Things that are good

- screen fits very well
- corners are the right size
- the flap closing system works -> flexible hinges were a good idea
- lidar fits
- side brush fits

## Second assembly (2019.09.30)

### Modifications following first assembly

- add screw holes for
  - big PCB stack
  - main brush
  - side brush
  - wheels fix (3D printed)
  - dust collector / pump part (3D printed)
- rearranged components to fit
- enhanced wheels holes shapes / position
- new design for front wheel fixation
- printed new corners on the Prusa printer -> 3D printed threads worked very well

### Things to enhance

- position of screw holes of
  - big PCB stack
  - side brush
- take the flap on top more towards the middle -> dust collector can't be taken out as it is
  - move lidar and screen towards the border
- replace front wheel fix so that there is no friction anymore
- cut top in plexiglass
- correct alignment of dust collector / pump part and main brush part!

### Things that are good

- height of the wheels compared to the brushes -> the brushes are in contact with the floor
- wheels fit nicely
- the robot is heavy enough to have the big wheels "squeezed"
