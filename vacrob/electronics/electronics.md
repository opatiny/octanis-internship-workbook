# Electronics

It is important to design the outer case in a way that put forward the electronics inside, indeed, the goal of the robot is to show the ecosystem developed by the company, which mainly consists of the easy to assemble PCBs and the software / firmware.

The robot required some functionalities that had already been developed, like the computer board. However, some boards had either to be modified (DC motor module) or completely designed (distance sensing module).

## Power supply

Three packs in serie of four 18x680 batteries in parallel are used as a power supply. This results in a voltage of 11.1V. The advantage of these batteries is that they can be fixed at different places inside the robot, which allows to optimize its size.
