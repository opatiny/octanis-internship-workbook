### Modifications following second assembly

- used some of the M3 clear acrylic screws 
  - they look very nice
  - they screw better in the 3D printed PLA threads
- adapted position of main brush
  - slided hole to the side
  - added 5mm thick MDF spacers to make it higher
- swapped flap and lidar on top part
- modified face bumper hole to fit the bumper 3D printed part
- added the bumper 3D printed part

### Things that are good

- the relative position between the main brush and the dust collector pump part is quite good
- the flap allows to take out the dust collector
- the bumper hole is better than before

### Things to enhance

- still adapt the position of the flap a bit
- model a part that will act as a spacer for the main brush that would also guide the dust (avoid it to go everywhere in the robot)
- cut the top and bottom out of acrylic glass, the faces as well? -> is it still too early?
- find a solution to the side brush position: as it is, it doesn't allow to clean the corners well
