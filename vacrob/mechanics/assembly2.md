### Modifications following first assembly

- added screw holes for
  - big PCB stack
  - main brush
  - side brush
  - wheels fix (3D printed)
  - dust collector / pump part (3D printed)
- rearranged components to fit
- enhanced wheels holes shapes / position
- new design for front wheel fixation
- printed new corners on the Prusa printer -> 3D printed threads worked very well

### Things that are good

- height of the wheels compared to the brushes -> the brushes are in contact with the floor
- wheels fit nicely
- the robot is heavy enough to have the big wheels "squeezed"
- the corners 3D printed threads are good

### Things to enhance

- position of screw holes of
  - big PCB stack
  - side brush
- take the flap on top more towards the middle -> dust collector can't be taken out as it is
  - move lidar and screen towards the border
- replace front wheel fix so that there is no friction anymore
- cut top and bottom out of plexiglass
- correct alignment of dust collector / pump part and main brush part!
- find a way to fix the screen in place -> metal bars?
